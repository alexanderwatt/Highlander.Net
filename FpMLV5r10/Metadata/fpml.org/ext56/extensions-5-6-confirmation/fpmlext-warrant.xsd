				Traditional warrants are issued in conjunction with a Bond 
				(known as a warrant-linked bond), and represent the right 
				to acquire shares in the entity issuing the bond. In other 
				words, the writer of a traditional warrant is also the issuer 
				of the underlying instrument
				
				Naked warrants are issued without an accompanying bond, and 
				like traditional warrants, are traded on the stock exchange. 
				They are typically issued by banks and securities firms. 
				These are also called covered warrants, and are settled for 
				cash, i.e. do not involve the company who issues the shares 
				that underly the warrant. In most markets around the world, 
				covered warrants are more popular than the traditional warrants 
				described above. Financially they are also similar to call 
				options, but are typically bought by retail investors, rather 
				than investment funds or banks, who prefer the more keenly priced 
				options which tend to trade on a different market. Covered 
				warrants normally trade alongside equities, which makes them 
				easier for retail investors to buy and sell them

								The terms of issue may require one warrant to be exercised to trigger settlement. 
								Alternatively, a number of warrants may need to be exercised.

								The conversion ratio will affect the absolute price of the warrant on a per 
								share basis. It is therefore important to know the conversion ratio of a 
								warrant series before investing.
