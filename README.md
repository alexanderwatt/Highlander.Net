# Highlander.Net is a real-time event driven valuation engine for markets products.

The Mission - 
Build a “re-usable component library”, not just analytics libraries, but also workflows, calculation engines and other useful widgets
Build a “new product methodology” based on these

Why? - 
Improve development productivity and quality
Deliver 30-40* new products in 1-2* years
Reduce model development time down to 10 days*
Deliver structured/cross product tool quickly

How? - 
Build generic engines that implement the standard QR workflow, and extend it with product-specific behaviour using a “plug and play” approach.

Features - 
1. Event Triggers: new/modifications in data e.g. market data, trade date and reference data
2. Worksteps: curve generation and value calculation workflows, wrapped up as services
3. Other data: instrument, business conventions, calendars, etc.
4. Generic applications: viewers, editors along with Microsoft Excel automation

Value - 
Highlander enables a new product valuation workflow to be developed as re-useable set of components, for example:
Server-based engines providing standard curves and valuations using live market data and bonked trader;
Distributed Custom curve/valuation engines running on grids to speed up intensive calculations.
